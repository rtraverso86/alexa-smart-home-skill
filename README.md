# alexa-smart-home-skill

Rust version of the Python Lambda for AWS to integrate Alexa with Home Assistant.

## Porting Source

The source of the porting, saved into this repo as `lambda_function.py`, is
a fork with a few tweaks of the original lambda function described by
[the official Home Assistant documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa.smart_home/#add-code-to-the-lambda-function)
and can be found [on github](https://gist.github.com/jjmerri/fe22ca8ee0e80805005d670ac7f7818c).
